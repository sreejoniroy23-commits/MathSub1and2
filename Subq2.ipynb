    "\n",
    "In this section, I focus on Sub-Question 2 of the research project:\n",
    "\n",
    "“How do perceptions of social-media visibility differ among users in the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany?”\n",
    "\n",
    "(H₀): There is no statistically significant difference in visibility scores between users in the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "(H₁): There is a statistically significant difference in visibility scores between at least two of the four countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to examine whether users from different European countries experience different levels of visibility on social media, for example, how much control they feel over their feed, how transparent the content is, and whether they believe the platform shows them what they want to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because visibility is measured using Likert-scale survey items, I will create a visibility score and compare this score across the four countries.\n",
    "To investigate this properly, the analysis below will:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Load the cleaned dataset used in this study,\n",
    "\n",
    "-Select and combine the visibility-related survey items,\n",
    "\n",
    "-Check normality assumptions to decide which statistical test is appropriate,\n",
    "\n",
    "-Run a group comparison test to see whether visibility differs across countries,\n",
    "\n",
    "-Perform post-hoc tests (if needed) to explore which countries differ from each other,\n",
    "\n",
    "-Visualize the results using a boxplot or barplot, and\n",
    "\n",
    "-Interpret the findings in the context of the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, I can provide a clear, data-driven answer to whether perceptions of social-media visibility vary significantly between the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany."

    "In this first step, I loaded the cleaned dataset that I will use to answer Sub-Question 2.\n",
    "After loading the file into a dataframe, I did some basic exploratory checks to understand how the data is structured and whether everything looks correct before moving on to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 81 rows and 59 columns, which means we have 81 survey responses with a wide range of demographic, fairness, visibility, and algorithm-related questions.\n",
    "To get a quick first impression, I printed the first five rows. This helped me confirm that the dataset loaded correctly and that the column names match the survey structure (for example: “I scroll through recommendations”, “I feel like I am in control of my feed”, “I trust the algorithm to recommend me content fairly”, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used df.info() to check the data types and missing values. Most columns are stored as object types because they contain text-based Likert-scale responses (e.g., Agree, Disagree, Neutral). A few numerical columns exist, but most are categorical. There are also some empty or irrelevant fields like Name and Last modified time, which have no useful information for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sub-question 2 focuses on differences between countries, I checked the distribution of respondents per country. The majority of participants are from Spain (35) and the Netherlands (23), followed by Greece (8) and Germany (5). There are also a few entries from countries like Canada or France, but those will likely be removed later because they are not part of the comparison between the four target countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I printed the full list of column names with their index numbers. This step helps me identify which survey questions belong to the “visibility” construct so I can work with them in the next step. Since there are 59 variables, labeling them this way makes it easier to pick out the specific visibility-related items later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this first EDA step confirms that the dataset is structured correctly and gives me a better understanding of the variables I will use when comparing visibility scores across the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany"

After applying the mappings, the visibility items were successfully transformed into numbers ranging from 1 to 5, and I verified this by printing the converted values.\n",

    "Next, I checked the percentage of missing values for each visibility question. Most items had around 3.7% missing values, which is low and manageable for analysis. Two items had slightly higher missingness (around 4.9%), but still acceptable for creating a composite score.\n",

    "Finally, I calculated an overall visibility_score for each participant by taking the mean of all visibility items. This gives one numerical value per person representing their general perception of social-media visibility. The summary statistics show that the visibility scores range from 2.64 to 4.27, with an average of around 3.47, which suggests that most participants reported moderate to moderately high perceptions of visibility.\n",

    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Visibility Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, I explored the overall behaviour of the visibility_score before running any statistical tests. This helped me understand how the data is distributed and whether it met any assumptions for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the summary statistics, the visibility score has 78 valid responses, with a mean of 3.47 and values ranging between 2.64 and 4.27. This showed that most participants fall around the middle of the scale, meaning their perceptions of visibility are generally moderate. Only 3 values were missing, which is a very small amount and does not affect the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise the distribution, I created a histogram. The histogram shows a fairly smooth, centred distribution without extreme skewness. Most scores cluster between 3.2 and 3.7, which makes sense since the score is an average of several 1–5 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the research question compares countries, I also checked how many respondents come from each one. Spain (35) and the Netherlands (23) make up the majority of the sample, while Greece (8) and Germany (5) are much smaller groups. There are also a few responses from other countries, but these will not be included when I run the final statistical test, since sub-question 2 focuses only on four European countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then plotted a boxplot of the visibility score by country. This plot makes it easier to visually compare the distributions before doing the formal test. Spain and the Netherlands seem to have similar medians, while Greece and Germany show more variability because of their smaller sample size. A few outliers also appear for some countries, which is expected in behavioural survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I ran a Shapiro–Wilk test to check if the visibility scores follow a normal distribution. The p-value was 0.454, which is above 0.05. This means I cannot reject normality, and the visibility score is approximately normally distributed. This information is important for choosing which statistical test to run in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this EDA confirms that the visibility score is reasonably well-behaved and suitable for comparing across countries."

    "**Statistical Testing for Differences in Visibility Score Across Countries**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, I tested whether visibility perceptions differ among users from the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany, which is the focus of Sub-Question 2. Before running the tests, I filtered the dataset so that only respondents located in these four countries were included. This resulted in 71 participants, with the following group sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Spain: 34\n",
    "\n",
    "-Netherlands: 23\n",
    "\n",
    "-Greece: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "-Germany: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these groups are uneven in size (especially Greece and Germany), I decided to run both a parametric test (ANOVA) and a non-parametric test (Kruskal–Wallis) to strengthen the reliability of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "-ANOVA Results\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA tests whether the average visibility score differs across the four countries.\n",
    "The results were:\n",
    "\n",
    "F-statistic: 0.65\n",
    "\n",
    "p-value: 0.58\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the p-value is much greater than 0.05, the ANOVA indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in visibility scores between the four countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Kruskal–Wallis Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Because two of the groups were small (n = 7 and n = 5), I also ran a Kruskal–Wallis test, which does not assume normality or equal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistic: 2.50\n",
    "\n",
    "p-value: 0.48\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to ANOVA, the Kruskal–Wallis test also shows no significant difference in visibility scores across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Post-hoc Dunn Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the overall tests were not significant, I still ran a Dunn post-hoc test to check for any pairwise differences. All Bonferroni-adjusted p-values were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms that no individual country pair shows a meaningful difference in visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests consistently indicated that perceptions of social-media visibility do not significantly differ among users from the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany. This means that, based on the data collected, users across these four European countries report similar levels of visibility on social media platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, real-world data shows that users in different countries actually have quite similar experiences on global platforms. It’s possible that the social media algorithms are standardized across these regions, leading to similar visibility perceptions. It’s also normal in research to find that the differences we expect don’t always appear, and that’s a valid and important finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while we might have hypothesized that one country would have higher visibility perceptions than another,but our data indicates that users in the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany report quite similar levels of visibility. This finding is valuable and shows that, in this case, the visibility experience is relatively consistent across these countries."

    "**Final Interpretation and Answer to Sub-Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this sub-question was to investigate whether perceptions of social-media visibility differ among users in the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany. After preparing the visibility score and running both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal–Wallis) tests, the results consistently showed no statistically significant differences between the four countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA resulted in a p-value of 0.58, and the Kruskal–Wallis test produced a p-value of 0.48, both well above the common 0.05 threshold. This means that based on the survey data, there is no evidence that users in these countries perceive social-media visibility differently. The Dunn post-hoc test further confirmed this, as every pairwise comparison returned a p-value of 1.0, indicating no meaningful country-to-country differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, this finding goes against what one might initially expect. One could assume that countries with stronger digital infrastructure (such as the Netherlands) might experience higher levels of perceived visibility compared to countries with smaller or less digitally developed populations (such as Greece). However, the data suggests that visibility perceptions appear to be quite similar across these four countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible explanation is that major social-media platforms operate globally with standardized algorithms, which may create relatively uniform user experiences regardless of regional differences. This would result in users across different European countries reporting similar visibility levels, even if their local digital ecosystems differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer to Sub-Question 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data collected, perceptions of social-media visibility do not significantly differ between users in the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany. All four groups report comparable visibility experiences on social media platforms.\n",

    "**Limitations and Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the analysis of visibility scores across the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Germany produced clear results, several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the sample sizes were uneven, especially for Greece (n = 7) and Germany (n = 5). These small groups reduce the statistical power of the tests and make it harder to detect true differences even if they exist. A larger and more balanced sample would strengthen the reliability of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the data is based on self-reported Likert-scale responses, which can introduce subjective bias. Participants may interpret “Agree” or “Neutral” differently, and their responses can be influenced by mood, context, or social desirability. Additionally, converting qualitative Likert answers into numerical values is a practical but imperfect method that can introduce measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that the survey was collected using convenience sampling, which may not represent the full population of social-media users in each country. Most responses came from Spain and the Netherlands, meaning the experiences of users in Greece and Germany may not be as accurately captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the study only measured visibility perceptions using a specific set of questions. Other factors—such as platform usage patterns, cultural attitudes toward social media, or the types of platforms used—were not included in this sub-question but could influence visibility experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the analysis provides a useful first insight into cross-country similarities in visibility perceptions and demonstrates a structured approach to statistical testing within the scope of this project."
