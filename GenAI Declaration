Appendix A: GenAI Declaration ( Coding, Interpretation, and Reporting)

In these two sub-assignments, ChatGPT (GPT-5), developed by OpenAI, was used strictly within the permitted scope of proofreading, clarification, and learning support.

Tool Details

Name & Version: ChatGPT (GPT-5)


Publisher: OpenAI


URL: https://chat.openai.com


Description of Use

Generative AI was used to support the assignment by:

helping debug specific Python coding errors,
Markdowns


clarifying the selection and interpretation of statistical tests (e.g., Levene’s test, Welch ANOVA, Games–Howell),


explaining statistical outputs and guiding how to understand them, and


improving clarity, structure, and academic tone in selected parts of the written report.


AI assistance was used only as a proofreading, clarification, and learning tool. All code, interpretations, explanations, and written sections were reviewed, rewritten, adapted, and verified by us to ensure they accurately reflect the dataset, our analytical process, and the assignment requirements. No unauthorised sources were used, and no material was copied from other students.

Prompts Used (Examples):
“Help me debug this Python error…”


“Which statistical test is appropriate here?”


“Explain this output in simple terms.”


“Can you help me phrase this paragraph more professionally?”


Scope of AI Assistance

Generative AI provided broad support across the assignment through proofreading, helping interpret statistical concepts, clarifying error messages, and strengthening the overall academic structure and readability of the report. All AI-assisted content was independently verified and rewritten by us.

Student Declaration

We take full responsibility for the content of this assignment, including all coding, statistical decisions, interpretations, and written work. We understand the limitations and risks associated with using generative AI and have ensured that all outputs were critically evaluated and validated by us.
